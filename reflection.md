Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I made a bird class! I used all the methods provided and tried to relate them to the daily life of a bird as best as I could. Admittedly I was not very creative with most of them but some of them esp the moving around methods I felt more comfortable and inspired to write more detailed code about.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I only implemented the eat() method for the bird to grab and eat food so this was supplementary to the grab method.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was difficult to get started but once you got past the first 3 methods it was smoother. It is easy to be lazy in this assignment as we are not being judged on our creativity or elaborateness rather its jus if we implement or not. My advice for the future would be to start early, commit often and give yourself time to proofread and document.
